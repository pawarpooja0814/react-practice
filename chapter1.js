// What is react ?
// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that can manage their own state, making it easier to build complex and interactive web applications. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, improving performance and user experience. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in web development.
